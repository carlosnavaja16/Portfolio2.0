                    <h4>Finding Myself</h4>    
                    <p>
                        My name is Carlos Rossi. I am a student at Broward College pursuing a degree in Information Technology as well as a minor in Mathematics.
                        I was born in the city of Barquisimeto, Venezuela. However, when I was thirteen, my father accepted a job in Weston, Florida, and my young
                        family was quickly uprooted. In Weston, my father, mother, younger sister, and I quite literally found ourselves in a foreing land with a
                        foreing language. Since I was enrolled in english lessons back home it only took me roughly a year to become fluent in english. 
                        
                        We moved here around the start of summer vacation. So in those first couple of months before I met friends in school; 
                        I stayed home and tinkered with my computer. Eventually this would lead to a cycle of completely ruining the PC and then finding ways
                        to fix it. It was around my final year of highschool that I began to acquire an interest in software and its development. I enrolled in 
                        AP Computer Science, my first programming class with Java as a language.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Making Progress</h4>  
                    <p>
                        I have always been intrigued and captivated by problem solving; so, after graduating from high school, I chose to persue a career in 
                        software engineering. Additionally I made a personal goal to complete a minor in mathematics. As a kid I dreamed of one day building or 
                        designing something I could call my own, now as an adult I see that I will do that through the development of software. My interest in 
                        problem solving that eventually led me to programming also made me gravitate towards mathematics. I am excited and eager to utilize my
                        passion and knowledge in a professional environment.

                        Currently, I work as a mathematics tutor and as a full-time studen. When my tutor cap is on, I am responsible for assisting my student
                        in understanding the material the view in class, devicing effective ways of testing those skills and helping them with homework.
                        When I am a student, I have been able to maintain 3.0 GPA every semester; while I also enjoy getting involved in various
                        on-campus organizations including the TALK CSE intership.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>For The Future</h4>  
                    <p>
                        While I am still working towards my Associates of Science degree, I am eager to gain experience as a engineer in a software development
                        related discipline. I hope to be challenged in a way that will allow me to develop my leadership and technical skills as well as communication
                        abilities. I feel that by gaining these skills, I will be better able to succeed as a leader in my future professional career.
                        I hope to work in a fast-paced, high-energy work environment after graduation.

                    </p>
